# Simulations-of-Braitenberg-Vehicles
<ul>
<li> The repository contains the simulations using the python library Turtle. </li>
<li> Note that the code contains preassumed starting position and other data for better presentation. It can be tested for other values too with change of values in the code. </li>
<li> The velocity of vehicle is taken as vel = k/(k1+k2*d*d) while in case of inhibition vel = k*(k1+k2*d*d), where k,k1,k2 being constants and d being the distance between stimulus and vehicle. </li>
<li> Upon executing the python code a window appears with the Vehicle (Red circle, with Purple circle indicating sensor positions) going along its trajectory with respect to Stimulus source (in Black). The images below are reference to trajectory of vehicles 2a,2b,3a,3b respectively. </li>
