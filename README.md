# Simulations-of-Braitenberg-Vehicles
<ul>
<li> The repository contains the simulations using the python library [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html). </li>
<li> Note that the code contains preassumed starting position and other data for better presentation. It can be tested for other values too with change of values in the code. </li>
<li> The velocity of vehicle is taken as vel = k/(k1+k2*d*d) while in case of inhibition vel = k*(k1+k2*d*d), where k,k1,k2 being constants and d being the distance between stimulus and vehicle. </li>
<li> Upon executing the python code a window appears with the Vehicle (Red circle, with Purple circle indicating sensor positions) going along its trajectory with respect to Stimulus source (in Black). The image below is a reference to vehicle 2a trajectory.
